### Requirements

The Swarm mainnet uses Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai) for on-chain activities - therefore you **MUST** configure a Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint. This package **ASSUMES** that you have successfully configured and [installed the Nethermind xDai package](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/nethermind-xdai.dnp.dappnode.eth), but provides you an option to customize this (see below).

#### Custom RPC endpoint

If you wish to use a different RPC endpoint instead of [installing Nethermind xDai](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/nethermind-xdai.dnp.dappnode.eth), you must change the following options:

* Set bee's `BEE_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT` in the [config](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/swarm.public.dappnode.eth/config) to your desired Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint.
* Set the Bee Dashboard [Blockchain RPC URL](http://dashboard.swarm.public.dappnode/#/settings) to your desired Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint.

**NOTE: For the benefit of decentralization and blockchain health, it is recommended to run your own node.**

#### Network Ports

If you are running your DAppNode within a network that has a UPnP compatible router, the P2P port (1634) will automatically be forwarded by the router to the appropriate port on the DAppNode. Otherwise, to ensure optimal performance of your node, you should configure port forwarding of TCP port 1634 to the DAppNode's internal IP address.

### Funding your node

When starting `bee` on the `mainnet` Swarm, you will see messages like this on the [logs](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/swarm.public.dappnode.eth/logs):

```

Of very import note in the above log files, you will see your node's ethereum address. This is the **address on Gnosis Chain** to which to send xDAI (for Gas) and xBZZ (BZZ tokens bridged from Ethereum mainnet to Gnosis Chain). Follow the log file's hint and head on over to the [fund your node](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/fund-your-node) documentation for details on how to fund your node so it may become part of the swarm mainnet!

Once you have sent the xDai and xBZZ to the node's address it will take a few moments for the node to detect these transactions. Once the transactions are  automatically detected the node will commence initialization.

For more information on configuring the `bee` node, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/).

#### Starting with no xBZZ

If your desire is to run a node as storage only for the benefit of the Swarm, first, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èüêù. This doesn't limit your ability to earn rewards (currently limited to bandwidth exchange). Therefore, it is possible to *only* fund the node's address with xDAI for the initial chequebook deployment, but this does *not* require any chequebook deposit - therefore in the [config](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/swarm.public.dappnode.eth/config) you can set the 'Initial chequebook deposit (xBZZ)' to 0. The node will still be able to participate in the Swarm, though you will not be able to purchase stamps (upload your own data) or access the network at a higher speed that would require bandwidth payments.

### Staking

Since `bee` version `1.10.0`, storage incentives have been activated for staking. The minimum to stake is `10 xBZZ`. Transfer this amount to your node's wallet, and then you may execute the stake by using the following shell command:

```bash
curl http://bee.swarm.public.dappnode:1635/stake/100000000000000000 -X POST
```

The above parameter specifies 10 `xBZZ` in it's atomic units. **CAUTION:** Remember that BZZ uses **16 decimals**.

### Bee Dashboard

This dashboard is a UI that allows to you work with your node easily. You can access it by clicking the "UI" link below or [here](http://dashboard.swarm.public.dappnode/).

By default, the node API links are preconfigured. You may customize these [settings](http://dashboard.swarm.public.dappnode/#/settings).
